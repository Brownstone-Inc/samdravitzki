/**
 * The idea is to make a game that makes the user feel like they're playing
 * the drums.
 *
 * How do we do this?:
 * The approach I want to take is by the user entering a repeated pattern of
 * key presses different beats will play and if every pattern has an assoicated
 * beat they will very easily be able to play something that sounds good. I like
 * this approach because it adds an element of discovery where the player can
 * find different beats by trying patterns. Gaining skill with the tool is done
 * by mastering these patterns to play the sounds you want to hear on demand.
 *
 * The element of discovery:
 * I think we can also develop the element of discovery further by adding other instruments
 * into the background if the beat is played at a consistent tempo and could change
 * other variables depending on where the pattern is played on the keyboard or what
 * keys are in the pattern.
 *
 * Visualisation:
 * Not sure yet how to go about this but I want the visuals to reinforce to the user
 * that when they are playing a pattern that they should keep repeating it and to communicate
 * to the user when they have changed the pattern. I also like the idea of it mimicing the
 * design of a drum machine. I also think its important to communicate to the user what
 * loop they are playing, this should have the name of the loop but more importantly something
 * visual to represent the loop
 *
 * Used Drumhaus (https://github.com/mxfng/drumhaus/tree/main) an in browser
 * drum machine based on tonejs alot as a reference for this
