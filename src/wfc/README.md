## Wave function collapse âšª

I have always wanted to build an implementation of wave function collapse and I have tried to do it a few different times before but could never figure it all out

At the moment I am thinking I want this project to include...

1. A simple tile editor
   - Where you can define the tiles and it encodes how the created tile relates to other tiles
   - I am thinking either pixel based or a simple grid-based vector line style
2. A tile placement system
3. 2D implementation of WFC algorithm
4. Simple WFC visualisation (does not have to be as detailed as Oksta)

### TODO

- [ ] Implement bitmap variation of wave function collapse
- [ ] Implement tile map variation of wave function collapse
