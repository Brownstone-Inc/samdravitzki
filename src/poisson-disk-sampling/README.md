## Poisson Disc Sampling ðŸŸ¡

I want to learn to different algorithms useful for procgen, poisson disc sampling is an interesting algorithm because of how it generates data that seems random but also looks good due to how uniform it is. I also want to develop my skills at implementing and using unique algorithms like this, pds felt like a great place to start because it is relativly simple but still have a few hidden challenges
