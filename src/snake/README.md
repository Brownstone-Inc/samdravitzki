## Simple snake ðŸŸ¢

### Brief

I want to understand what it takes to publish a working interactive experiment, so I am going to begin really simple with an implementation of snake and then try do something orginal with it

### Scope

The implementation of snake doesn't have to be anything special but there has to be some kind of original twist

- [ ] Implement basic snake game
  - [x] Snack self collisions
  - [x] Track score
  - [ ] Increase the speed when snack is eaten
  - [x] Hide the snake game somewhere in the page
- [ ] Snake controlled by gravity
  - [ ] control gradient of background with input

### Bugs

- [ ] appears to be a little lag when the snake is about to eat the snack
- [ ] when snack was eaten another snack was not rendered on the screen
- [ ] Snack sometimes generates in the same position as the snake

### Ideas

- Could be cool if the snake can break out of the canvas into the html page
- For the aesthetic it would be cool to see if I could make it work in isometric view
- I would like to add some kind of original idea to snake. Maybe something like adding momentum or a third dimension could be cool?
- Support mobile
